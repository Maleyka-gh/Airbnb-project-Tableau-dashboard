Airbnb is a revolutionary platform in the travel and hospitality industry, allowing individuals to rent out their private spaces to guests. It has transformed the way people travel, offering more personal and often more cost-effective accommodations than traditional hotels.
  Airbnb's market includes a vast array of properties, from single rooms to entire homes, catering to a wide range of travellers, from solo backpackers to large families and groups. The platform operates globally, with listings in urban cities, quiet countryside locations, beachfront properties, and more.
  Hosts on Airbnb set their pricing based on factors like location, amenities, property size, and the number of bedrooms. Prices fluctuate based on demand, seasonality, and local events. Understanding the pricing strategies, particularly how different property characteristics, like the number of bedrooms, affect rental prices, is crucial for hosts to remain competitive and for guests to find the best options for their needs.
